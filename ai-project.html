							<h2>Project Purpose and Scope</h2>
							<p>Developed a sophisticated web application for Prestige Lock and Door that automates the tedious process of matching products from supplier flyers with items in their inventory database. This AI-driven solution significantly reduced manual work and improved accuracy in product identification and pricing. The project demonstrates my skills in creating practical applications of artificial intelligence for solving real-world business problems.</p>
							
							<h2>Professional Contributions</h2>
							<p>I led key aspects of this project that showcased my technical abilities and leadership skills:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>AI Algorithm Development</strong> - Designed and implemented vector embedding matching algorithms that significantly improved product identification accuracy</li>
								<li><strong>Security Implementation</strong> - Created a robust login and authentication system to protect sensitive business data</li>
								<li><strong>Infrastructure Engineering</strong> - Developed Docker containerization solutions for consistent deployment and scaling</li>
								<li><strong>Cross-functional Collaboration</strong> - Worked with business stakeholders to translate requirements into technical solutions</li>
								<li><strong>UX Design</strong> - Contributed to interface design that balanced technical capability with ease of use</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2>Technical Challenges Overcome</h2>
							<p>This project presented several complex challenges that I successfully addressed:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Developed custom vector embedding algorithms to overcome the limitations of off-the-shelf solutions</li>
								<li>Created an innovative approach to text similarity matching that handled industry-specific terminology</li>
								<li>Implemented efficient database architecture to handle large product catalogs while maintaining performance</li>
								<li>Balanced algorithm sensitivity to enable accurate matching without excessive false positives</li>
								<li>Integrated multiple data sources with different formats and quality levels into a unified system</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2>Business Impact and Outcomes</h2>
							<p>This project delivered transformative results for Prestige Lock and Door:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Reduced product matching time by approximately 85%, saving over 20 hours of staff time weekly</li>
								<li>Improved matching accuracy from ~70% to over 95%, reducing pricing errors and customer issues</li>
								<li>Enabled staff to focus on higher-value tasks, resulting in a 15% increase in sales follow-up activities</li>
								<li>Decreased time-to-market for new supplier offerings by 60%</li>
								<li>Created a scalable system that has successfully adapted to three new supplier integrations</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2>Professional Growth and Reflection</h2>
							<p>This project represented a significant milestone in my professional development:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Deepened my expertise in AI applications for business process automation</li>
								<li>Enhanced my ability to communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders</li>
								<li>Developed leadership skills through coordinating cross-functional aspects of the project</li>
								<li>Built confidence in my ability to architect end-to-end solutions from conception to deployment</li>
								<li>Refined my approach to balancing technical excellence with practical business requirements</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to leverage cutting-edge technology to solve real business problems. The skills developed are directly applicable to my career goals in software engineering and artificial intelligence, where I aim to create solutions that combine technical innovation with practical business value.</p>
